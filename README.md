# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript Starter and Boilerplate

## Getting Started

Using `create-next-app` to clone project
```bash
pnpm create next-app -e https://github.com/tqxdev/next-starter my-next-app
```

It is encouraged to use **pnpm** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
pnpm install
```

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
